\title{
KAML: Kinship Adjusted Multiple Loci Best Linear Unbiased Prediction
}
\description{
KAML is originally designed to predict phenotypic value using genome- or chromosome-wide SNPs for sample traits which are controled by limited major markers or complex traits that are influenced by many minor-polygene. In brief, KAML incorporates pseudo QTNs as fixed effects and a trait-specific K matrix as random effect in a mixed linear model. Both pseudo QTNs and trait-specific K matrix are optimized using a parallel-accelerated machine learning strategy.}
\usage{
KAML(pfile="", gfile="", kfile=NULL, dcovfile=NULL, qcovfile=NULL,
  pheno=1, SNP.weight=NULL, GWAS.model=c("MLM","GLM", "RR"), GWAS.npc=NULL,
  prior.QTN=NULL, prior.model=c("QTN+K", "QTN", "K"),
  vc.method=c("brent", "he", "emma"),
  K.method=c("center", "scale", "vanraden"),
  Top.perc=c(1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1), Top.num=15,
  Logx=c(1.01, 1.11, exp(1), 10), qtn.model=c("MR", "SR", "BF"),
  BF.threshold=NULL, binary=FALSE, bin.size=1000000, max.nQTN=TRUE,
  sample.num=2, SNP.filter=NULL, crv.num=5, cor.threshold=0.3,
  count.threshold=0.9, step=NULL,

\arguments{
\item{pfile}{phenotype file, one column for a trait, the name of each column must be provided(NA is allowed)}

\item{GWAS.npc}{the number of PC that will be added as covariance to control population structure}
\item{prior.QTN}{the prior QTNs which will be added as covariants, if provided prior QTNs,  KAML will not optimize QTNs and model during cross-validation}
